
1. gcc can be used to generate dependencies
        using -M and -MF <file.d>

2. -M includes all system header files, so we change it to -MM

3. what happens when we rename or delete a header file?
        mv banner.h bannerv2.h
        edit main.c to include bannerv2.h instead of banner.h
        then invoke make

nacuna@PHN0341:~/git/makefile_autodependencies$ make
gcc -I. -MM -MF main.d main.c
gcc -I. -c -o main.o main.c
make: *** No rule to make target 'banner.h', needed by 'banner.o'.  Stop.

4. solution to above problem? add -MP flag to compiler 

This option instructs CPP to add a phony target for each dependency other
than the main file, causing each to depend on nothing. These dummy rules
work around errors make gives if you remove header files without updating the
‘Makefile’ to match.
        This is typical output:
        test.o: test.c test.h

        test.h:

5. when there is no .d files yet, make will complain that there is no .d file.

nacuna@PHN0341:~/git/makefile_autodependencies$ make
Makefile:15: main.d: No such file or directory      <-
Makefile:15: banner.d: No such file or directory    <-
gcc -I. -MP -MM -MF banner.d banner.c
gcc -I. -MP -MM -MF main.d main.c
gcc -o final main.o banner.o

        Solution? 
        1. create the .d file while making the .o
        2. use -MMD now since we are also using -o in the same command 

        new rule is:
        $(CC) -I. -MP -MMD -c -o $@ $<

6. .d files clutter our working area. put them in a separate directory.

        read about order-only prerequisites

        Solution?
        1. add a directory where .d files will do
        2. modify GCC compilation option so that .d will be saved to dep directory
                add -MF $(DEP_DIR)/$*.d option
